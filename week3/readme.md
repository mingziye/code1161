TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
In this week, I found some methods to get different mathods using ranges, and also learnt how to creat a binary search. it is quite hard to understand how to begin, but it becomes fine after understanding what I need to do, it's a shame to understand the whole week 3 things to late as it quite like a skip comparing to previous week to me (may be because I'm stupid). however, it is cool to have a hangman as a great example of many knowledge althouth it also needs to spent time to analyse many steps why using these loops or how can make one without the example. 

However, I'm still not clear with those guessing game, when I should break the function or continue. or why I need to do them.  actually I'm the one who full of messy questions but I don't know where to find the point of question to ask. I will try my best at hoiday trying to work on them as best as I can.
